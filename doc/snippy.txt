INTRODUCTION                                             *snippy-introduction*

Snippy is a snippets plugin for Neovim written in Lua.


==============================================================================
USAGE                                                           *snippy-usage*

                                                          *snippy-usage-setup*

Snippy includes an optional |snippy.setup()| function for you to quickly
configure it according to your needs. See the |snippy-setup-options| section
for information on the available options. Below is an example showing most of
the available options:
>lua
    require('snippy').setup({
        snippet_dirs = '~/snippets',
        local_snippet_dir = '.snippets',
        hl_group = 'Search',
        enable_auto = false,
        scopes = {
            _ = { },

            lua = function(scopes)
                if vim.api.nvim_buf_get_name(0):find('_spec.lua$') then
                    table.insert(scopes, 'busted')
                end
                return scopes
            end,

            php = { '_', 'php', 'html', 'javascript' },
        },
        mappings = {
            is = {
                ["<Tab>"] = "expand_or_advance",
                ["<S-Tab>"] = "previous",
            },
            nx = {
                ["<leader>x"] = "cut_text",
            },
        },
    })
<
It's also possible to define options for a specific buffer using the
|snippy.setup_buffer()| function. Example:
>vim
    autocmd BufRead,BufNewFile *_spec.lua lua require('snippy').setup_buffer(0,
        \ { scopes = { '_', 'lua', 'busted' } })
<

Both `setup()` and `setup_buffer()` are optional and only need to be called if
you want to change a configuration parameter.

                                                       *snippy-usage-mappings*

Snippy comes with no active mappings by default, so you need to define some.
From Vimscript, the easiest way is to use the `<Plug>` mappings.

For example, to use `<Tab>` to expand and jump forward, `<S-Tab` to jump back:
>vim
    imap <expr> <Tab> snippy#can_expand_or_advance() ? '<Plug>(snippy-expand-or-advance)' : '<Tab>'
    imap <expr> <S-Tab> snippy#can_jump(-1) ? '<Plug>(snippy-previous)' : '<S-Tab>'
    smap <expr> <Tab> snippy#can_jump(1) ? '<Plug>(snippy-next)' : '<Tab>'
    smap <expr> <S-Tab> snippy#can_jump(-1) ? '<Plug>(snippy-previous)' : '<S-Tab>'
<
You can also define different mappings for expanding and jumping forward.
To expand with `<C-]>`, jump forward with `<C-j>`, and jump back with `<C-k>`,
set it up like this:
>vim
    imap <expr> <C-]> snippy#can_expand() ? '<Plug>(snippy-expand)' : '<C-]>'
    imap <expr> <C-j> snippy#can_jump(1) ? '<Plug>(snippy-next)' : '<C-j>'
    imap <expr> <C-k> snippy#can_jump(-1) ? '<Plug>(snippy-previous)' : '<C-k>'
    smap <expr> <C-j> snippy#can_jump(1) ? '<Plug>(snippy-next)' : '<C-j>'
    smap <expr> <C-k> snippy#can_jump(-1) ? '<Plug>(snippy-previous)' : '<C-k>'
<
You can optionally define mappings for cutting and storing the currently selected text
in the `$VISUAL` or `$TM_SELECTED_TEXT` variables:
>vim
    nmap g<Tab> <Plug>(snippy-cut-text)
    xmap <Tab> <Plug>(snippy-cut-text)
<
To use these mappings, follow these steps:

    1. Select text in visual mode.
    2. Press the key mapped to the `<Plug>(snippy-cut-text)` (or the `cut_text`
       action in the setup options).
    3. Type the trigger and expand the snippet.

The selected text will replace the `$VISUAL` placeholder in the snippet. The
same can be done in normal mode using text objects.

When mapping from Lua using |nvim_set_keymap()|, you can use
|snippy.can_expand()| and |snippy.can_jump()|. The Vimscript functions above
are just convenience wrappings around those. You can also map keys by using
the `mappings` setup option (see |snippy-setup-options|).

                                                       *snippy-usage-snippets*

Normally, your custom snippets should be placed in
`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/nvim/snippets`. However, any `snippets` directory in
|runtimepath| will be searched for snippets. Snippy uses a file format based
on SnipMate's, with some modifications (which are covered below). So the
following patterns are accepted:

    - snippets/{filetype}.snippets
    - snippets/{filetype}_{name}.snippets
    - snippets/{filetype}/{name}.snippets
    - snippets/{filetype}.snippet
    - snippets/{filetype}/{trigger}.snippet
    - snippets/{filetype}/{trigger}/{description}.snippet

Files with the `.snippet` extension contain a single snippet each, whereas
files with the `.snippets` extension can be used to declare multiple snippets
using the following format:
>
    # Load also snippets from these scopes
    extends html, css, javascript

    # Define higher priority
    priority 1000

    snippet trigger1 "Description for snippet 1" [option]
    	This is the first line.
    	This is the second line.
    snippet trigger2 "Description for snippet 2" [option]
    	This is the first line.
    	This is the second line.
<
While it is recommend to enclose the description in double quotes, Snippy also
supports a legacy syntax by which everything that comes after the trigger is
part of the description:
>
    snippet trigger3 Description for snippet 3
    	This is the first line.
    	This is the second line.
<
Please be aware that the legacy syntax doesn't support snippet options.

A single empty line at the end of the snippet body is discarded, regardless of
being indented. This is for maintaining compatibility with SnipMate, but also
allows snippets to be conveniently separated by a single blank line.

                                                      *snippy-snippet-options*

The `option`s control the behavior of the expansion of the snippet and are
optional. Currently supported are the following:
    - `w` Word boundary - The word expands only when the trigger is on a word
        boundary. This is the default behavior.
    - `i` In-word expansion - The snippet gets expanded even if the trigger is
        only part of the word, up to the cursor.
    - `b` Beginning of line - The snippet is only expanded if its trigger is
        the first word on the line, only preceded by whitespace.
    - `A` Autotrigger - The snippet is expanded automatically when the trigger
        is typed. Requires the `enable_auto` option to be `true`. Note that
        this feature, because it checks every key pressed, may theoretically
        affect the performance of your editor when used.

Custom `option`s can be defined via the setup option `expand_options` to restrict
expansion in specific scenarios. For example, consider latex snippets which
should only be expanded when inside of a math environment or in comments:
>lua
    expand_options = {
        m = function()
            return vim.fn["vimtex#syntax#in_mathzone"]() == 1
        end,
        c = function()
            return vim.fn["vimtex#syntax#in_comment"]() == 1
        end,
    }
<
Snippets with the above custom expand `option`s can then be written:
>
    snippet trigger1 "Description for snippet in mathzone" m
        ...
    snippet trigger2 "Description for autosnippet in comment" Ac
        ...
<

                                                      *snippy-usage-indenting*

Make sure each line in the snippet definition is indented with spaces or tabs
in order to be recognized as such. By default, indenting is done with tabs,
but it is also possible to indent with spaces, as long as it is consistent and
there is no mixing of tabs and spaces. If you want Neovim to indent your
custom snippets with two spaces, for example, create a file
`after/ftplugin/snippets.vim` and add the following:
>vim
    setlocal expandtab tabstop=2 sw=2 
<
This could also be achieved with an |autocmd|. Indenting with spaces is a
Snippy-specific feature and might not be compatible with other snippet plugins
like SnipMate.

                                                        *snippy-usage-extends*

When creating `*.snippets` files, you can use two directives to modify how
snippets are loaded: `extends` and `priority`. The `extends` directive
specifies that other scopes should also be loaded when the current scope is
loaded. For instance, to load HTML and CSS snippets for PHP files, add the
following line: >

    extends css, html

This will ensure that the CSS and HTML snippets are available when you are
working with PHP files.

                                                       *snippy-usage-priority*

Snippy follows the |runtimepath| order when loading snippets, which
means snippets defined in folders coming later in the list will always
override those loaded before. So, if you put your custom snippets in
`after/snippets/`, they should override any snippets provided by plugins in
case of name conflict.

Another way to determine which snippets should be loaded first is to use the
`priority` directive, currently only possible in `.snippets` files. The
default priority is 0, so you can set your own snippets' priority to a higher
value, like 100, for them to override lower priority snippets. The priority
directive affects all snippets listed after it:
>
    priority 100
    snippet trigger1
    	...
    snippet trigger2
    	...
<
                                                         *snippy-usage-scopes*

Scopes are the term used in Snippy to refer to a group of snippets that should
be loaded for a filetype. They are generally named after the filetype they
were created for. You can, however, give them any name you want, as long as
you tell Snippy to load them for a filetype using the `scopes` setup option.

The global scope is identified by an underscore (`_`). Snippets in the global
scope will be loaded for every filetype.

                                                     *snippet-usage-lua-added*

Another way to add snippets is by using the available Lua API function
|snippy.add_snippets()|. This may be convenient for adding temporary snippets,
testing snippet ideas, or for user who just may prefer it over editing
`.snippets` files.

==============================================================================
SNIPPET SYNTAX                                         *snippy-snippet-syntax*

Snippy should be compatible with the full LSP snippet syntax, which in turn is
based on the original TextMate syntax. Additionally, the SnipMate syntax is
supported for compatibility.

Currently the parser for a particular snippet is chosen based on the source
the snippet was loaded from. If it was loaded from a SnipMate file, the
SnipMate-style parser will be used. When expanding LSP snippets from
completion items, the default behavior is to parse using the LSP syntax
parser.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
LSP Snippet Syntax                                         *snippy-lsp-syntax*

The full LSP snippet syntax can be found at
https://github.com/Microsoft/language-server-protocol/blob/main/snippetSyntax.md.

The only point where Snippy deviates from the LSP syntax in in the handling of
transformations. Transformations are very complex and require support for
Javascript regex parsing. Instead we support Vim-based regular expressions and
a simplified format, which see |snippy-snipmate-transform| below for more
details.

Note: the LSP syntax  is only supported when expanding LSP provided
completion items. This prevents incorrect expansion of eval blocks, for
example. When expanding snippets defined in `.snippet(s)` files, SnipMate's
syntax is used instead.

When adding snippets programmatically via |snippy.add_snippets()|, the `kind`
field can be used to specify the syntax.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SnipMate's Syntax                                     *snippy-snipmate-syntax*

SnipMate syntax is also based on the TextMate syntax and so largely compatible
with the LSP syntax. A basic SniMate-style snippet body looks like this:
>
    for (${1:i} = 0; $1 < ${2:limit}; $1++) {
    	System.out.println($1);
    }
<
                                                        *snippy-snipmate-eval*

This syntax also allows Vim code to be evaluated inside backticks (``):
>
    Current date is `strftime('%c')`
<
By default, Vimscript is assumed, but you can also have Lua code by starting
the block with `!lua` or `!l` separated from the actual code with a blank space:
>
    Today is `!lua os.date('%Y-%m-%d')`
<
It is also possible to write `!vim` or `!v` to explicitly mean Vimscript,
which is the default when no language is indicated.

                                                   *snippy-snipmate-transform*

Transformations are supported for tabstops and variables, with the caveat that
Vim regular expressions are to be used instead of Javascript ones. The
`format` (replacement) part is also a Vim regular substitution pattern. For instance:
>
    This ${1:word} will be changed to uppercase: ${1/.*/\U\0/g}
<
Will result in:
>
    This word will be changed to uppercase: WORD
<
The transformation has the following syntax:
>
    ${<stop or variable>/<replacement>/<flags>}
<
The `replacement` and `flags` parts may be empty.

                                                      *snippy-snipmate-visual*

The special variable `$VISUAL` holds text previously selected and stored using
the `snippy.cut_text()` function or the `<plug>(snippy-cut-text)` mapping.
This is equivalent to the `$TM_SELECTED_TEXT` variable defined by the
TextMate/LSP syntax.

Note: for convenience, the SnipMate parser does expand any LSP variables
(`$TM_SELECTED_TEXT`, etc.) present in the snippet body, in addition to
`$VISUAL`.

<

snippy.add_snippets({snippets}[, {opts})      *snippy.add_snippets()*
    Adds new snippets to the given {scope}. Snippets added this way are
    assigned a higher priority value by default.

    {snippets} is a table, mapping scopes to tables of snippets, each table
    having triggers as keys and the corresponding snippets as values. Snippet
    can be a `string` or a table containing some fields:
        - `priority`: defaults to 999.
        - `prefix`: snippet trigger. Defaults to the table key.
        - `body`: `string` or list of `string`s.
        - `kind`: either "snipmate" or "lsp". See |snippy-snippet-syntax|.
        - `description`
        - `option`: see |snippy-snippet-options|.

    Example:
>lua
    snippy.add_snippets(
        { python = {
            ['for'] = "for $1 in $2: $3",
            ['while'] = { 
                body = "while $1: $2",
                priority = 1000
            }
        } },
        { priority = 100, kind = 'lsp' }
    )
<
    {opts} is an optional table with the following options:
        - `priority`: number indicating the snippet priority. Defaults to 999.

snippy.get_snippets([{scope}])                         *snippy.get_snippets()*
    Returns a table with all available snippets.

    {scope} is an optional string to filter by scope. See
    |snippy-usage-scopes|.

Some Vimscript |autoload| functions are also provided for convenience,
specially for mappings:

snippy#can_expand()                                      *snippy#can_expand()*
    See |snippy.can_expand()|.

==============================================================================
SETUP OPTIONS                                           *snippy-setup-options*

This plugin can be configured by passing a dictionary to the Lua function
`snippy.setup(...)`. The following options are supported:

snippet_dirs ~
    A comma-separated (if a `String`) list of directories containing snippets.
    Snippets must be placed in the top-level directory, with no nested
    `snippets/` subfolder.
        Type: `String` or `List`
        Default: vim.api.nvim_list_runtime_paths()

local_snippet_dir ~
    Path to a directory containing project-specific snippets. May be relative.
        Type: `String`
        Default: .snippets

hl_group ~
    Highlight group used for placeholders.
        Type: `String`
        Default: SnippyPlaceholder

choice_delay ~
    Defines the delay in milliseconds before the choice menu is displayed.
        Type: `Number`
        Default: 100

enable_auto ~
    Enables snippets with the `A` option to be automatically triggered. See
    |snippy-snippet-options|.
        Type: `Boolean`
        Default: false

scopes ~
    A table with filetypes as keys. Each value must be a table containing a
    list of scopes or a function that receives the calculated list of scopes
    for the current buffer and should return a new (possibly modified) list of
    scopes.
        Type: `Table`
        Default: nil
        Example:
>lua
        scopes = {
            -- Load busted.snippets for *_spec.lua
            lua = function(scopes)
                if vim.api.nvim_buf_get_name(0):find('_spec.lua$') then
                    table.insert(scopes, 'busted')
                end
                return scopes
            end,
            -- Load HTML and Javascript snippets for PHP
            php = { '_', 'php', 'html', 'javascript' },
        }
<
mappings ~
    A table for easily mapping keys in Lua. Each key must be a table or a
    string with one or more mode identifier characters (see |map-listing|).
    The values should be tables mapping LHS mapping values to RHS values.
    RHS should be a string or a `snippy.mapping.*` enum value.
        Type: `Table`
        Default: {}
        Example:
>lua
        mappings = {
            -- Mappings for insert and select mode
            [{ 'i', 's' }] = {
                ["<Tab>"] = "expand_or_advance",
                ...
            }
            -- Same, with string as identifier for modes 
            is = {
                ["<Tab>"] = "expand_or_advance",
                ...
            }
            -- With enum value as RHS:
            x = {
                ["<Tab>"] = snippy.mapping.CutText,
                ...
            }
        }
<
    Valid string LHS values and corresponding enum values are the following:

    | String              | Enum                             | ~
    +---------------------+----------------------------------+ ~
    | expand_or_advance   | snippy.mapping.ExpandOrAdvance   |
    | expand              | snippy.mapping.Expand            |
    | next                | snippy.mapping.Next              |
    | previous            | snippy.mapping.Previous          |
    | cut_text            | snippy.mapping.CutText           |

expand_options ~
    Add new `option`s to limit triggering in certain scenarios. See
    |snippy-snippet-options|.
        Type: `Table`
        Default: {}

virtual_markers ~
    Requires nvim >= `0.10.0`.
    Enable virtual text markers that show all available (inactive) tabstops
    and placeholders.
        Type: `Table`
        Default: >lua

        virtual_markers = {
            enabled = false,
            -- Marker for all placeholders (non-empty)
            default = '',
            -- Marker for all empty tabstops
            empty = '',
            -- Marker highlighing
            hl_group = 'SnippyMarker',
        }
<
    The marker value can contain the following special formatting symbols:

        - `%n`: current stop number.

BUFFER OPTIONS                                         *snippy-buffer-options*

It is also possible to set configuration specific to a buffer by calling
`snippy.setup_buffer(...)` function. The following buffer-specific options are
supported:

scopes ~
    Can be set to a table containing a list of scopes or a function that
    receives the calculated list of scopes for the current buffer and should
    return a new (possibly modified) list of scopes.
        Type: |Table|
        Default: nil

COMMANDS                                                     *snippy-commands*

:SnippyEdit {file}                                                *:SnippyEdit*

    Opens an existing snippet file in a new split by default (supports
    |<mods>|). Completion available. Passing an empty {file} opens the default
    snippets file for the current filetype.

:SnippyReload                                                  *:SnippyReload*

    Invalidates current cache, allowing newly added/edited snippets to be
    loaded.
